# Hi, I’m Gavin Childers
I’m a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Central Arkansas, passionate about coding and building real software. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with coding projects, developing backend console-based tools, and researching new programming techniques and technologies.

## 🧑‍💻What I’m Working On
Currently, I’m reconstructing a school project designed to benchmark various data structures. As the year progresses, I’m excited to deepen my understanding of programming language principles and continue refining my skills.

## 💻 Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** C++  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio, Git  
- **Platforms:** Windows  
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms

## 📚 Education
Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Central Arkansas (expected May 2027). I’ve enjoyed courses like Data Structures and Programming Principles, and I’m currently diving into Discrete Mathematics and Principles of Programming Languages.

## 🔍 Selected Projects

### Data Structure Performance Benchmark Tool
A C++ tool I built to compare how different data structures—like `std::list`, binary search trees, AVL trees, hash tables, and red-black trees—handle insertion, search, and deletion on large datasets. Running tests across multiple machines helped me understand practical performance trade-offs and system constraints. This project sharpened my ability to analyze algorithm efficiency and exposed me to practical challenges in system performance.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Sorting and searching algorithms in C++  
- Building command-line utilities from scratch  
- Introductory SQL and data management  
- Writing clean, maintainable code with proper documentation
