I’m a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Central Arkansas, passionate about coding and building real software. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with coding projects, developing backend console-based tools, and researching new programming techniques and technologies.

## 🧑‍💻 What I’m Working On
Currently, I'm working on a couple of projects and concepts to build my portfolio, and to make strides towards my goals:
- **Data Structure Performance Benchmarking:** A reconstruction of an old school project, where I’m designing a console-based program that tests different data structures and algorithms. The goal is to produce a final report showing not just which one performs best overall, but also when each structure is the best choice depending on the scenario.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** A console-based game of Tic-Tac-Toe, featuring Local Play and procedural AI opponents. It’s a chance to build modular game pieces (Boards, Game Rules, etc.) while also diving into procedural AI logic to create a decently competitive, non-repetitive opponent.
- **AutoCart:** A shopping list and reminders app for mobile devices, designed to re-add items to your list based on fixed intervals (e.g. every 3 months) or specific dates (e.g. every May 2nd). It’s built to help users stay on top of tasks and purchases that need to happen on a schedule—automatically adding them to their list when it’s time.


## 💻 Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** C++, Python
- **Tools:** Visual Studio, Git  
- **Platforms:** Windows  
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms

## 📚 Education
Pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Central Arkansas (expected May 2027). I’ve enjoyed courses like Data Structures and Programming Principles, and I’m currently diving into Discrete Mathematics and Principles of Programming Languages.

### 🔍 Selected Projects

#### Data Structure Performance Benchmark Tool
A C++ tool I built to compare how different data structures—like `std::list`, binary search trees, AVL trees, hash tables, and red-black trees—handle insertion, search, and deletion on large datasets. Running tests across multiple machines helped me understand practical performance trade-offs and system constraints. This project sharpened my ability to analyze algorithm efficiency and exposed me to practical challenges in system performance.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Sorting and searching algorithms in C++  
- Building command-line utilities from scratch  
- Introductory SQL and data management  
- Writing clean, maintainable code with proper documentation
